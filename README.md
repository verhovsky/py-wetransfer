py-wetransfer
=============

Python 3 script for downloading [WeTransfer](https://www.wetransfer.com/) files from the command line

Usage
=====

You should have a WeTransfer address

https://www.wetransfer.com/downloads/XXXXXXXXXX/YYYYYYYYY 

or a short-form one

https://we.tl/XXXXXXXXXXXX

Execute

    python3 wetransfer.py "https://we.tl/XXXXXXXXXXXX"

and it will output the actual URL of the file that you can download. 

You can then use `wget` or `curl` to download that URL, like this:

    wget $(python3 wetransfer.py "https://we.tl/XXXXXXXXXXXX")
    curl -O $(python3 wetransfer.py "https://we.tl/XXXXXXXXXXXX")

September 2021 notes
====================

I have updated this script to work with the latest WeTransfer links (as of September 2021). Many thanks to Alejandro Alonso, Marcos Besteiro LÃ³pez and Gary Watson for starting this off.

I have tested it on macOS with Python 3.9
